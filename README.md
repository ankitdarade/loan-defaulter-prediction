# loan-defaulter-prediction
To find loan defaulter using machine learning,pandas,various libraries
librariesused are pandas,matplotlib,sklearn 
tech:-machine learning problem falls under classification problem
Project approach:-
1.given with 3 dataset 
2.have to merge dataset on id but id column was having different names with simialr matching ids 
3.by using join we can join it but size of 3rd dataset was big so taken only unique matching row from 3 sataset 
4.performed cleaning handling null values removing outliers.
5.perform EDA on dataset where we can see 52 and 28 age group is maximum defaulter.
6.further we can see maximum transaction made by which country.
7.we can use heatmap corelation to find eleminate feature. also we can use VIF and eleminate if 2 feature as correlating with each other.
8.After all final spliting data and performing ml algorithm decision tree,RF,Logistic regresion.
